title: Assembly and binning for metagenomic samples with high intra-population diversity
---

Binning is to cluster similar contigs assembled from reads based on the coverage and sequences composition (e.g., kmer composition) of contigs. The resulting bin, which we also called metagenomic assembled genome (MAG), as a representative of the true collection of species population genome.
